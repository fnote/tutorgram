1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,625
Previously on "Castle"...

2
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:04,928
Who killed my mother?

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,131
No, Kate. I give you a name, I know you.

4
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,153
You'll run straight at him.

5
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,691
I might as well shoot you where you stand.

6
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:10,493
They are coming to kill you,
and I'm not gonna let 'em.

7
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:11,853
I'm gonna end this.

8
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:16,174
No one outside of this immediate family

9
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:18,678
ever needs to know about this.

10
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,211
As far as the world is concerned,

11
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:22,259
Roy Montgomery died a hero.

12
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,253
Kate!

13
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,388
It was supposed to be over.

14
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:31,490
Montgomery sacrificed
himself to keep her safe.

15
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:34,891
This is so much bigger than you realize.

16
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,215
Hello.
Mr. Castle,

17
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,063
I'm a friend of Roy Montgomery's.

18
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:41,384
We need to talk.

19
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:43,966
He says she's safe now on one condition.

20
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,757
She can't go near her mother's case.

21
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:48,182
She'll listen to me. I can steer her away.

22
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,414
No! Ah!

23
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:03,495
Beckett!

24
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,438
Castle!

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,423
Beckett!

26
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,923
Castle, I'm here!

27
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:08,204
Beckett, hang on!

28
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:22,154
Either this is the most
boring dream I've ever had

29
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,615
or you can't sleep either.

30
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,286
It's not a dream. More like a nightmare.

31
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,141
Is this about your valedictorian speech?

32
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:29,952
It's my chance to say something important,

33
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,234
something worthy.

34
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,955
I don't want to blow it, but I
feel like I have nothing to say.

35
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,115
You mean nothing compared to

36
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,794
the great sacred texts of mankind

37
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,167
or Winston Churchill's speech to harrows,

38
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,960
or Steve Jobs' address to Stanford?

39
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,517
You know, maybe you
should pick some speeches

40
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:45,007
st a little less daunting
to compare yours to,

41
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,061
like, um, "Say Anything" or "Twilight."

42
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:49,741
It's not supposed to be this hard.

43
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,657
You know, the most
worthwhile things in life

44
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,740
are often the most difficult.

45
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:55,809
For example--

46
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:00,393
Wow. That really is a smart phone.

47
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,362
Of course you don't understand

48
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,742
why she's taking her graduation
speech so seriously.

49
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,894
You were probably the guy who
had nothing on but boxers

50
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,159
underneath his gown.

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,554
That is so insulting.

52
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,313
If you must know, I was naked underneath.

53
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,377
Oh, I'm sorry. I stand corrected.

54
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,658
So how is the father of
the graduate taking it?

55
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,307
I already have a plan to drown my sorrows.

56
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,915
After the ceremony, my mother
goes off to the Hamptons,

57
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,607
Alexis will be doing her all-nighter.

58
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,812
I will be distracting myself
with a double feature

59
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,781
of "The Killer" and "Hard Boiled."

60
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,812
Wow. That is a double feature.

61
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:29,996
You like John Woo?

62
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,480
The bloodier the better.

63
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,851
You wouldn't want to... join me, would you?

64
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,367
Actually, I'd love to.

65
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:44,937
You coming, Castle?

66
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,215
Yeah. Please.

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,014
Hey.

68
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:48,889
So?

69
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,619
So we've got a Hispanic male, late 20s.

70
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,173
Cabbie spotted the body about an hour ago

71
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:53,258
and called it in.

72
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,526
We got an I.D.?

73
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:55,465
Nah. We checked his pockets.

74
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,108
There's no phone, keys, or wallet.

75
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,002
And we're checking prints right now.

76
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,628
From the blood trail, it
looks like he was shot

77
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,983
before he entered the alley.

78
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:01,859
He was hit in the shoulder

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,136
with what looks like a .357,

80
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,618
but the kill shot--
point-blank, execution style,

81
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:09,190
with a 9 millimeter.

82
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,777
Two guns. Could be more than one shooter.

83
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:13,005
Was C.S.U. able to trace that blood trail

84
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,283
from the first shot?

85
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,650
It starts around the corner.

86
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:17,113
There's no visible point of origin,

87
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,613
but the teams are still looking.

88
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,289
Well, this is a bad neighborhood.

89
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,138
Maybe it was a mugging gone wrong?

90
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,920
Maybe.

91
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,808
These grooves in his shoulder indicate

92
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,060
that he was carrying
something, and it was heavy.

93
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:28,914
I'd say at least 30 pounds.

94
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:32,175
I'm even seeing traces of skin
tissue in his fingernail.

95
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,521
I may be able to get D.N.A.,

96
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:35,892
but I'll know a lot more once
I get him back to the morgue.

97
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,734
Uh, his pockets may have been empty,

98
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,953
but it looks like he was trying
to hide something in his shoe.

99
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:45,551
Lock picks?

100
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:48,753
Now why would someone
be needing lock picks?

101
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,296
He's a thief.

102
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,768
Orlando Costas.

103
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,030
A couple of domestic B&Es, but
suspected of a dozen more.

104
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:56,655
He used to run with the Cazadores.

105
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:57,481
Cazadores?

106
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,088
They're a violent street
gang that deals in drugs,

107
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,334
arms, and larceny,

108
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,890
but all of Orlando's priors are
back when he was a teenager.

109
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,137
He hasn't been arrested in years.

110
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:05,158
Maybe he got back in the game.

111
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,163
I don't know. He went a long
way to clean up his act.

112
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,916
Did four years active in the military,

113
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,721
discharged with honors last year.

114
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:13,171
Spent his rotation as an M.P. in Germany.

115
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,874
Military police? He really
did clean up his act.

116
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,001
If this guy went straight,

117
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,997
then how did he end up dead in an alley?

118
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,580
Did you check for next of kin?

119
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:21,687
Uh, his folks are dead,

120
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:24,484
but we managed to track down a
girlfriend--Marisol Castaneda.

121
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,178
Esposito's bringing her in right now.

122
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,013
All I know is, he was
with me in bed last night

123
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,967
when I went to sleep.

124
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:32,088
I woke up this morning,

125
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,063
and both him and my car were gone.

126
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:35,929
Where did he go?

127
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,858
I figured he'd gone to the career center

128
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,654
to check the job listings.

129
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,543
He does that every morning.

130
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,091
He'd been looking for work?

131
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:44,038
For months.

132
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,251
Orlando served his country.

133
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,393
You'd think that means something,

134
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:48,952
but it's been tough,

135
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:50,710
especially after my hours got cut.

136
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,387
So he was under financial pressure?

137
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:55,099
Is it possible that he
went back to old habits?

138
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:56,820
No.

139
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,287
Look, Marisol, we know that
he ran with the Cazadores.

140
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,854
Do you think that--
I said no.

141
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,022
He went through hell to escape that life.

142
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:07,361
It's why he enlisted, to get out,

143
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:09,390
to be a better man for me...

144
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,700
A better father to our son.

145
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,194
So how about you stop trying
to make this his fault

146
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,858
and find whoever killed him?

147
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,380
What kind of car do you have?

148
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,214
Two blocks away from the alley,

149
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,794
blood smeared on the arm rest--
This is definitely it.

150
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,977
He was shot somewhere else
and then he came here?

151
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,822
Why not go home? Why not go get patched up?

152
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,669
He was meeting someone in that alleyway.

153
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,656
Phone.

154
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,918
His last call was 4:47 A.M.,
just before he died.

155
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,358
Run that number.
Right.

156
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,033
Hey, Beckett, gun.

157
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,386
It's a .38.

158
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,179
Recently fired.

159
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,940
So it was a shootout.

160
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,617
That's how he got the shoulder wound.
Which means,

161
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:48,681
wherever he came from, there
might be another body.

162
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,012
I know where he was coming from.

163
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:50,627
Where?

164
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,730
His last entry was 299 First Avenue.

165
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,605
Wait. What's at 299 First Ave.?

166
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,387
Captain Montgomery's house.

167
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,747
We're just thankful no one was hurt.

168
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,356
Believe me, so am I.

169
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:07,734
Ever since Roy died,

170
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,434
I've slept with his .357 in the nightstand.

171
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:11,659
So it was just the one guy?

172
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,003
As far as I know.

173
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:15,425
He was taking files out of the cabinet.

174
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:18,697
He had Roy's old laptop in his backpack.

175
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,943
When he saw me, he pulled his weapon,

176
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,975
so God help me, I shot him.

177
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,472
I think I hit him in his shoulder.

178
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,915
He fired back, and then he
crashed through the window.

179
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,579
Evelyn, was this the guy?

180
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,388
Yeah. That's him.

181
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:35,646
I'm glad Evan and the girls weren't home.

182
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:36,986
Funny thing is,

183
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,572
I wasn't supposed to be home either.

184
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:41,462
It's almost like he knew we
weren't supposed to be here.

185
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,351
Anything special about those files?

186
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,758
Just paperwork, legal documents,

187
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,339
notes on Roy's old cases.

188
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,505
What about his computer?
What--what was on that?

189
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:52,177
His old work files, but mostly,

190
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,787
I use it for Christmas cards and recipes.

191
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,867
They went after Montgomery's files.

192
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:02,151
Not valuables, not cash.

193
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,153
And now our thief is dead

194
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,047
and the files he took are missing?

195
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,076
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

196
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,694
What else would it be about?

197
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,983
Everyone here thinks Montgomery died

198
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,671
bringing a cop killer to justice.

199
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:14,295
We're the only ones who know
what he was really involved in

200
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:16,829
and his connection to your mother's murder.

201
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,497
Beckett, it can't be a coincidence.

202
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:20,609
Recheck the vic's rap sheet.

203
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,794
See if Montgomery was involved
in any of his old arrests,

204
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,524
and get on that number.

205
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:26,099
I want to know who he was
talking to just before he died.

206
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,876
Say something reassuring.

207
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,617
There are thousands of break-ins
in New York City every year.

208
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,570
This one feels different.

209
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,358
Well, that doesn't mean that it is.

210
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,211
Montgomery worked hundreds of cases.

211
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,582
Just because this guy was after files

212
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,266
doesn't mean he was after your mom's case.

213
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,221
Then why is our thief dead?

214
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,941
You know those people that
Montgomery was involved with,

215
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,009
he said that they wanted me dead,

216
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,701
that I was getting too close,

217
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,549
and he said that he was gonna give his life

218
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,839
in order to protect mine,

219
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,395
and they still tried to kill me.

220
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,667
I wake up sometimes, and I think to myself,

221
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,150
how the hell am I still alive?

222
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:20,303
It's like I'm just waiting
for that other shoe to drop.

223
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,969
What if this is that other shoe?

224
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:45,466

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

225
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:48,594
Things were finally getting better for her,

226
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,804
for us.

227
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,487
She was just coming out of her shell,

228
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,695
and now this?

229
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,652
Do you really think it's related

230
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,119
to her mother's murder case?

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,795
I hope to God it isn't.

232
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,138
Montgomery's friend was very clear.

233
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,775
She starts poking around
her mother's murder,

234
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,370
they'll come after her again.

235
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:07,673
I can't let that happen.

236
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,870
I know.

237
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,654
Thank you.

238
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:30,821
Did you get any sleep?

239
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:33,987
Not much.

240
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,481
Anything new on our victim?

241
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,517
We rechecked Orlando's rap sheet.

242
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:41,404
Montgomery wasn't involved
in any of his old arrests.

243
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:42,959
That break-in wasn't personal.

244
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,840
What about the call he
made before he was killed?

245
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,894
It's from a burner phone.
There's no registered owner.

246
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,370
Hey.
Hmm?

247
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,852
You're not in this alone.

248
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:53,877
I'm here.

249
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:57,719
I know.

250
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:04,614
Hey.

251
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,655
We may have been wrong

252
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,010
about why they hit Montgomery's.

253
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:10,566
Witnesses saw a Hispanic
male fleeing the alley

254
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,550
in a late-model Maroon DeVille.

255
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:15,242
Apparently he had gang ink on his neck--

256
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,411
a lion framed by a "C."

257
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:18,555
Cazador?

258
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,865
The very same gang that
our victim ran with.

259
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,063
Gangs.

260
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,193
If this guy was in that alley,

261
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,143
odds are, he killed Orlando.

262
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,524
Did we get a license plate?

263
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,636
Uh, no, but according to gang task force,

264
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:33,710
the ride matches the car
of one Vicente Delgado.

265
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,986
High-level shot caller for the Cazadores.

266
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:36,996
And get this.

267
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:40,186
His cousin Diego Gutierrez
was busted by Montgomery

268
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,294
for a double homicide in '95.

269
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,555
His lawyer's filed a motion for retrial

270
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,863
a month after Montgomery was killed.

271
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,144
Find him.

272
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,949
NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!

273
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,427
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

274
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:56,527
Let me see your hands!

275
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:00,671
Well, looky here,

276
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:01,989
a 9 millimeter.

277
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,952
Just like the gun that
killed Orlando Costas.

278
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,165
I already told you, I was
nowhere near that alley.

279
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,939
Fact is, your witnesses are blind.

280
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,964
The fact is, you knew Orlando Costas.

281
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,972
Yeah, I knew him once,
before he turned his back.

282
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,253
When was the last time you heard from him?

283
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:18,826
Not in years.
Hours.

284
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,472
Just before he was killed,
Orlando called a burner cell,

285
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,951
same phone that we found on you.

286
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,404
So why don't you just admit to
it and save yourself 30 years?

287
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,495
You had him break in to
Roy Montgomery's house

288
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,788
and steal your cousin's case files,

289
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,152
and then you shot him.

290
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,611
What you got, chica, huh?

291
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,014
Gun's not gonna be a match.

292
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:37,074
So that leaves you with what, a phone call,

293
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:39,598
and a couple of people who
saw a very common car?

294
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,755
You know why you can't
pin this on me, chica?

295
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:43,936
I wasn't there.

296
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,483
The hell you weren't.

297
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,232
That's gonna be ballistics.

298
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,164
Last chance to make a deal.

299
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,868
Book him on the drugs and weapons charge

300
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,835
and tell the D.A. I'm gonna
want to file for murder one.

301
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,217
It wasn't him.

302
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,967
What do you mean, it wasn't him?

303
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,785
The skin tissue that
Lanie was able to scrape

304
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,699
from underneath our victim's fingernails,

305
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:10,500
the lab was able to pull D.N.A.

306
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,088
We ran it against Vicente.

307
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,413
It's not a match.

308
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:16,226
In fact, it wasn't a match
to anyone in the system.

309
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,712
But it did match D.N.A. trace evidence

310
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,292
found at another crime scene.

311
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:21,356
Well, at least that's something.
What was the crime scene?

312
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,508
It was a shooting.

313
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,327
Beckett, it was your shooting.

314
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,375
D.N.A. confirms that the man

315
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,829
who killed Orlando Costas in that alley

316
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,284
is the same man who put
a bullet in your heart.

317
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:55,161
No leads for 11 months, and now this.

318
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,914
Does Gates know?

319
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:00,364
No.

320
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,834
Then we don't tell her.

321
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,852
If she finds out this is
a match to my shooting,

322
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,494
she'll take me off the case.

323
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,971
Maybe you should be off this case.

324
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,487
They tried to kill you once, Kate.

325
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:14,295
You keep going on this, they...

326
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,410
What's to stop them from trying again?

327
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:18,199
What's to stop them now?

328
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:19,759
No.

329
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,639
I've been waiting a year for this,

330
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,209
and I'll be damned if I let
someone else screw it up.

331
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,768
Hey, Javier.

332
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,238
Man, this just feels wrong.

333
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,361
We need to tell Gates.

334
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:50,264
Why...

335
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:53,141
So she can send Beckett home?

336
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,510
You think that's gonna work?

337
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,874
You think that's gonna stop her?

338
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,695
She's gonna investigate this case, Kevin,

339
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,466
whether she's on it or not.

340
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,360
The least we can do

341
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,779
is make sure that we have her back.

342
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:18,804
Hello.

343
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,433
I think you know why I'm
calling, Mr. Castle.

344
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:22,805
It's you.

345
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,603
Thank God. What the hell is going on?

346
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,470
Why'd they break in to Montgomery's place?

347
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,892
Well, most likely, it's a clean-up job.

348
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,959
Making sure that Montgomery had
nothing else incriminating

349
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,244
in his files.

350
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,230
As long as Beckett drops her investigation,

351
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,447
we still hold all the cards.

352
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:41,719
No, she's already on to her shooter.

353
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,028
She's not gonna let go.

354
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,560
Then we have a problem.

355
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:48,329
If she doesn't stop, they will retaliate.

356
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,670
Now I can't control the situation

357
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,702
if you can't control her.

358
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,034
I got enough on the drug
and weapons charges

359
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,837
to put you away for at least five years.

360
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,464
Five years of your life...

361
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,652
What's that worth?

362
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,703
I know you didn't kill Orlando.

363
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:32,741
But he called you,

364
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,806
and you talked to him for two minutes,

365
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,505
and you were in that alley.

366
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:40,020
Why?

367
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,241
There's nobody in here but you and me.

368
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,506
There's no cameras,

369
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,280
no microphones, no one's listening.

370
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,763
I can make all those charges go away.

371
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,643
Five years of your life back,

372
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,723
but you gotta tell me what you know.

373
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:11,562
He called last week.

374
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,745
Talking about "Times were bad,"

375
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,146
so I told him, "I can get you some work."

376
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,831
But he knew if he came
back to the Cazadores,

377
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,167
there'd be no leaving this time.

378
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,025
And all he really wanted was a loan

379
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,468
and could I help him out
for old times' sake.

380
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:27,445
Did you give it to him?

381
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,311
No. He begged me.

382
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:30,851
Said he was good for it.

383
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,343
Said he had something big coming up,

384
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:33,515
something that'd make him whole.

385
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:34,350
Did he say what?

386
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:37,114
No, but that morning, my phone rings,

387
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,534
and he said it'd all gone wrong,

388
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:42,180
he was desperate, talking about
they were gonna kill him.

389
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,492
Who's they?

390
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,569
Don't know.

391
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,195
But he was scared.

392
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,646
Why did he call you?

393
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,203
Protection, chica.

394
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,010
He said if I helped him
out, he'd come back,

395
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,724
and he knew that was the price.

396
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,551
So I told him where to meet.

397
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:58,898
But by the time I got
there, he was already dead.

398
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,556
You told him where to meet?

399
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:01,643
That's right.

400
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,689
You didn't tell anyone else?
No.

401
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,582
Did you see anything there?

402
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,031
White guy,

403
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:09,225
6'.

404
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,446
Caught a glimpse before the
night swallowed him whole.

405
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,856
They must have been
tapping Orlando's phone.

406
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,186
That's the only way they got there first.

407
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,754
But how did they know to
target Orlando for the job?

408
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,836
Because he was desperate for money.

409
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,259
Yeah, but how did they know that?

410
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,295
How did they know his background?

411
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,751
Because they knew him from the military.

412
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,358
He was hired by somebody he knew.

413
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,391
It's a place to start.

414
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:31,091
And whoever's gotten close
to that secret is dead.

415
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,101
I think it's clear, we're
in over our heads here.

416
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,662
Speak for yourself, bro.

417
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,034
Orlando's financials just came in.

418
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,349
He was underwater and
overdrawn until last week

419
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,762
when a wire transfer for
10 grand hit his account.

420
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,690
Let me guess. Untraceable?

421
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:43,457
So it's a dead end.

422
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,624
The deposits are,

423
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,788
but the debit withdrawals are not.

424
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:47,656
Right when the money came in,

425
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,211
Marisol started using it to pay bills.

426
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:50,937
Wait. If Marisol knew about the money...

427
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,861
Then she knew Orlando was up to something.

428
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,095
She lied to us.

429
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,849
Not only that, but according to the bank,

430
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,723
she cleaned out the entire
account an hour ago.

431
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:58,972
She's on the run.

432
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:13,630
I've got a few questions for
you before you leave town,

433
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,008
and this time,

434
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:16,625
I want the truth.

435
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:21,971
I'm telling you the truth.

436
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,006
I didn't know anything about the money.

437
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,212
Not until today.

438
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,415
So why do we have debits against it

439
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,854
the moment it appeared in your account?

440
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:33,028
Orlando--
It was your card, Marisol.

441
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,470
Who was Orlando working for?

442
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,329
Do you know what's gonna happen

443
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,132
if you don't cooperate?

444
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:40,940
You're gonna go to jail

445
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,844
and your kid's gonna go to foster care.

446
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:43,969
Is that what you want?
Beckett--

447
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,780
Marco on the streets,
enlisted by the Cazadores

448
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:48,619
at age 10 like his father,

449
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,131
dead in a gutter at 19!

450
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,632
Pudrete en el infierno!

451
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,143
Beckett...
That's enough.

452
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,984
Orlando said it was someone
he knew from the service,

453
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,589
someone dangerous.

454
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,843
But it was just a one-off,

455
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,974
a lot of money for an easy job.

456
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,946
And we needed the money.

457
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,469
What was the job?

458
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,907
They needed files...

459
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,846
from a dead cop's house.

460
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,347
What files?

461
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:17,324
All of them, any he could find,

462
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,982
this guy from the service,
did you get a name?

463
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:22,031
No.
Did you meet him?

464
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:22,894
No.

465
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,259
Did he ever call the house?

466
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,456
He left notes for Orlando in the mail box

467
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,872
with a time and place.

468
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,912
They were coded so I-I wouldn't know where.

469
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,493
But I was in the car once.

470
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,743
I saw where they met.

471
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:39,094
At a church

472
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,231
over on State Street.

473
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:44,383
Wednesday, you say?

474
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,686
Yeah, around 3:00 P.M.

475
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,471
He was meeting with someone.

476
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,823
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

477
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,891
But we're open to the public,

478
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,721
and we get a lot of
unfamiliar faces every day.

479
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,530
We usually just leave
them to their prayers.

480
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,566
If your donation box is any indication,

481
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,094
it looks like being open to the
public comes with a price.

482
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:04,953
Yes, well... it's not
the best neighborhood.

483
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,568
We catch gang kids and the
homeless all the time,

484
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,855
trying to take advantage of more
than just our outreach programs.

485
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,857
How do you catch them?

486
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:15,090
Here it is,

487
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,519
3:00 P.M. Wednesday.

488
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,335
There's Orlando.

489
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,039
That's him.

490
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:31,477
Damn it.

491
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,199
Come on. Come on.

492
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,465
Yes.

493
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:49,583
So that's what you look like.

494
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,485
I'm gonna run this through Army C.I.D.

495
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,904
If they met in the military
someone in Orlando's old unit

496
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:55,793
might be able to I.D. him.
No, no, we don't know who's involved

497
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:57,206
and we don't know how high this goes.

498
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,488
The minute we put this photo out there,

499
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,364
these people are gonna know.
He's gonna disappear,

500
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:01,528
and we'll never see him again.

501
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,935
We have to do this one on our own.

502
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,672
Beckett, that's impossible.

503
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:05,564
All we have is a face--

504
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,632
no name, no I.D., no way to find this guy.

505
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,658
Then we will find a way to find him.

506
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,676
I'm not gonna lose this lead.

507
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,183
How are we supposed to investigate

508
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,503
if we can't investigate?

509
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:19,612
You heard the lady.

510
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:21,147
We find a way.

511
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,630
Kate!

512
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,189
Don't die on me!

513
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,229
Who hired you to kill her?

514
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,269
Forget it. You'll never touch 'em.

515
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:23,662
Hey.

516
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:24,655
Hey.

517
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:27,030
I just got off the phone with Esposito.

518
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:28,469
Our killer had a keychain,

519
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,902
and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.

520
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:33,158
That could be any one of a thousand cars.

521
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,303
I know, it's a needle in a haystack,

522
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,499
but at least it's a haystack,

523
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,630
and they keep most of
their licenses on file.

524
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,633
Kate--
Yeah, he's probably using a fake I.D.

525
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,149
But we should be able to
narrow it down from there.

526
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,058
Kate.
What's wrong?

527
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,597
You, um...

528
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:49,033
You have to stop.

529
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:52,325
This investigation, you--you have to stop.

530
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,001
Castle, we already talked about this.

531
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:57,192
I'm fine. I'm in control.

532
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,889
No, you're not.

533
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,124
They are.

534
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:05,211
And if you don't stop,
they will kill you, Kate.

535
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:08,487
What are you talking about?

536
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,607
Before Montgomery went into that hangar,

537
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,989
he sent a package to someone,

538
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,657
someone... he trusted.

539
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,417
It contained information

540
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:23,132
damaging to the person behind all this.

541
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,228
Montgomery was trying to protect you.

542
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:30,775
But the package didn't arrive
until after you'd been shot.

543
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:33,795
Montgomery's friend...

544
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,572
struck a deal with them.

545
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:39,346
If they left you alone,

546
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:41,158
that package and the information inside

547
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,035
would never see the light of day.

548
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:46,510
But they made one condition--
you had to back off.

549
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:51,393
And that's the reason you're alive, Kate,

550
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:53,347
because you stopped.

551
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,845
How do you know this?

552
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,455
In order for the deal to work,

553
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:03,230
someone had to make sure
you weren't pursuing it.

554
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:06,906
Are you a part of this?

555
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,051
I was just trying to keep you safe.

556
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:19,338
By lying to me

557
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:21,751
about the most important thing in my life?

558
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,857
That lie was the only thing
that was protecting you.

559
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:25,513
Castle, I didn't need protection.

560
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,590
I needed a lead,

561
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,201
and you sat on it for a year.

562
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:35,005
Now who is this person? How do I find him?

563
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,053
He's a-a voice on the phone.

564
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:39,744
He's a shadow in a parking garage.

565
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,078
You met with him?

566
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,104
How do you know that he's
not behind my mom's murder?

567
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:48,183
How do you know that he's not involved?

568
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,375
And how the hell could you do this?

569
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,323
Because I love you.

570
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,977
But you already know that, don't you?

571
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,673
You've known for about a year.

572
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:03,842
Are you kidding me?

573
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,386
You're actually bringing this up right now,

574
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,837
after you told me that
you just betrayed me?

575
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,682
Kate, listen to me--

576
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:13,220
Listen to you? Why should I listen to you?

577
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,370
How I am even supposed to
trust anything that you say?

578
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,230
How are you s--

579
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:21,898
Because of everything we've
been through together!

580
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,944
Four years, I've been right here.

581
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:27,102
Four years just waiting for
you to just open your eyes,

582
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:28,423
to see that I'm right here

583
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,684
and that I'm more than a partner.

584
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,918
Every morning, I-I bring
you a cup of coffee

585
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,163
just so I could see a smile on your face

586
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,633
because I think you are the most...

587
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,733
remarkable...

588
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,409
maddening...

589
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:47,122
challenging...

590
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,105
frustrating person I have ever met.

591
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:54,400
And I love you, Kate, and if...

592
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,108
that means anything to you,

593
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,617
if you care about me at
all, just don't do this.

594
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,497
If I care about you?

595
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:05,588
Castle, you cut a deal for my life

596
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,510
like I was some kind of a child.

597
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,137
My life, mine...

598
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:12,453
You don't get to decide.

599
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:15,413
You keep going with this,

600
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,547
they're gonna decide.

601
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,645
They're gonna come for you, Kate.

602
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:20,906
Let them come.

603
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,703
They sent Coonan, and he is dead.

604
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:26,215
They sent Lockwood, and he is dead.

605
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,366
And I am still here, Castle,

606
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:29,863
and I am ready.

607
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,706
Ready for what,

608
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:33,922
to-to die for your cause?

609
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:36,180
This isn't a murder
investigation anymore, Kate.

610
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,538
They've turned it into a war.

611
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,398
If they want a war, then
I will bring them a war,

612
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,478
straight to their doorsteps.

613
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:49,852
Well, I guess there's just
nothing I can say, is there?

614
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:52,465
Okay, um...

615
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,881
Yeah, you're right, Kate,

616
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,157
it's your life.

617
00:26:58,598 --> 00:26:59,667
You can throw it away if you want,

618
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,318
but I'm not gonna stick
around and watch you,

619
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,433
so this is, uh...

620
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:05,190
over.

621
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,195
I'm done.

622
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,111
Everything okay?

623
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:41,533
Yeah. Fine. How's your speech coming?

624
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,690
I have watched or read

625
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,411
every graduation address ever written

626
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,918
and compiled all the best
advice into one speech,

627
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:48,254
and then I read it out loud.

628
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:50,394
And guess what I sounded like.

629
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,700
Like a pompous ass.

630
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm 18 years old. What the hell do I know?

631
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:57,278
Hey, look, everything you know,

632
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,051
everything you will know is...

633
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:00,939
is what's true for you.

634
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,839
All I know is, everything's changing.

635
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,687
Everything's going to be different,

636
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:08,485
and I'm so scared.

637
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:11,768
Of what?

638
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,325
Moving on.

639
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:17,992
Write about that.

640
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:20,272
That feels true.

641
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:09,676
Where's Castle?

642
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:10,744
He's off the team.

643
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,506
So what do we got?

644
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:17,137
Eastway rented 700 cars last Wednesday.

645
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,118
We believe our suspect
is going under the name

646
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,157
Cole Maddox.

647
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,550
He rented out of J.F.K.

648
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,092
It's a Kansas driver's license.

649
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,057
Now we did some digging.
It's a cover I.D.

650
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:25,903
Did he return the car?

651
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:27,270
No, but...

652
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:28,799
Eastway maintains

653
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,730
GPS tracking on all of its equipment,

654
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:33,341
so we tracked it to the Lower East Side

655
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,593
to a 1-block radius somewhere along here.

656
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:37,595
All right, you stay on grid.

657
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:38,551
Let us know if he moves.

658
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,885
Esposito, you're coming with me.

659
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:41,862
What are you doing?

660
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:43,323
You want to do this, you do it right.

661
00:29:43,891 --> 00:29:46,117
You put a team on that car and
you bring backup with you.

662
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:47,416
Ryan, this whole thing started

663
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,226
because of a group of corrupt cops.

664
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:51,217
How do you know there
aren't more out there?

665
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:53,908
We're about an inch away
from catching this guy,

666
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:56,552
and I'm not gonna blow it by
advertising our next move.

667
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,366
With all due respect,

668
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:58,725
this guy put a bullet in your heart

669
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:01,062
and then he disappeared into the ether.

670
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,180
You cannot go in there unprepared.

671
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:03,993
Unprepared?

672
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:08,462
I've been preparing for
this for the past 13 years.

673
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:13,705
Hey, Javier...

674
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,222
Man, don't let her do this.

675
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:17,660
It's too big of a risk.

676
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,258
It's all good, bro.

677
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,315
We got this.

678
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:27,100
Come on. We don't want
to miss her speech...

679
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:29,522
or the entire graduation.

680
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm almost ready.

681
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,159
Hey, we got him.

682
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:56,599
The doorman at the residency hotel
across the way I.D.'ed the car.

683
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:58,084
And the front desk clerk confirms

684
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,882
that Mr. Maddox is here on a 1-month lease.

685
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,367
They've agreed to let us in his room.

686
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,332
Get out of the way.

687
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,071
Clear.

688
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:11,711
Clear.

689
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:13,708
Montgomery's files.

690
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:18,839
His contact list?

691
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,862
What the hell were they looking for?

692
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,631
Not what. Who.

693
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,955
They grabbed Montgomery's wedding album.

694
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,980
Why?
They're looking for someone that he knew.

695
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:33,648
Maybe they found him.

696
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:35,812
We gotta get out of here.

697
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:37,002
I'm gonna call for backup.

698
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:37,982
We'll set up in the lobby--

699
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,045
Just tell me who's behind this.

700
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:18,113
You're wasting your time, detective.

701
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,791
You have no idea what you're up against.

702
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:23,587
Neither do you.

703
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:43,596
Actually...

704
00:33:44,702 --> 00:33:46,292
We know exactly who we're up against.

705
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:04,476
Help!

706
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:07,908
Oh! Oh, God.

707
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:10,757
No!

708
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:13,535
Oh, not like this. Come on.

709
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:19,520
Come on. No!

710
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:39,969
Castle.

711
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:58,884
Beckett!

712
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:00,165
Castle!

713
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:02,212
Beckett! Castle, I'm here!

714
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:03,808
No!

715
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:06,274
Oh, God. Castle!

716
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:07,384
Beckett, hang on!

717
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:10,465
Castle!

718
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:11,952
Beckett!

719
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:23,076
Castle?

720
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,398
Withholding evidence,

721
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:34,719
lying to a superior officer--

722
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:38,288
What you did dishonors this
city and dishonors the badge.

723
00:35:38,457 --> 00:35:40,382
Not only are you off this investigation,

724
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,250
I'm putting you both on
administrative leave

725
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:43,979
effective immediately.
Sir--

726
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,079
Don't you "Sir" me.

727
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,344
You don't deserve to wear the uniform.

728
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,578
Now hand over your badges and guns.

729
00:35:58,727 --> 00:35:59,692
Detective Beckett.

730
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:23,947
Keep it.

731
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:25,889
I resign.

732
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:32,641
There's a universal truth

733
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:33,819
we all have to face...

734
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:37,075
whether we want to or not.

735
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:41,181
Everything eventually ends.

736
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:44,790
As much as I've looked forward to this day,

737
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,117
I've always disliked endings...

738
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,550
The last day of summer...

739
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,486
The final chapter of a great book...

740
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:05,565
Parting ways with a close friend.

741
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:11,315
But endings are inevitable.

742
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:14,953
Javi.

743
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:17,837
I had to.

744
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:20,715
Leaves fall.

745
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:23,700
You close the book.

746
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:33,332
You say good-bye.

747
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:41,050
Today is one of those days for us.

748
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,578
Today we say good-bye to
everything that was familiar,

749
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:47,812
everything that was comfortable.

750
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,013
We're moving on.

751
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:02,748
But just because we're leaving,

752
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,066
and that hurts...

753
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,283
There are some people

754
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,161
who are so much a part of us

755
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,637
they'll be with us no matter what.

756
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,942
They are our solid ground...

757
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:20,953
Our North Star,

758
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:25,977
and the small clear voices in our hearts

759
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,968
that will be with us... always.

760
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,331
No, Alexis, I'll be fine.

761
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,261
I got a thousand cable
channels, I got my Xbox.

762
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,433
You have fun.

763
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,729
I will not worry about you
until lunchtime tomorrow.

764
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:59,179
I love you, too.

765
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,105
Beckett, what do you want?

766
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:06,019
You.

767
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:18,241
I'm so sorry, Castle.

768
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:20,683
I'm so sorry.

769
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,987
I'm so sorry.

770
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:32,288
What happened?

771
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:35,792
He got away, and I didn't care.

772
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:39,449
I almost died

773
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,252
and all I could think about was you.

774
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:45,569
I just want you.

775
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,884
Mister...

776
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:50,268
Smith?

777
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:52,908
Who are you?

778
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,912
You've been a very hard man to find.

779
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,527
What do you want?

780
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:01,221
You have some sensitive information

781
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:02,212
about my employer,

782
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:03,785
information that you've been using

783
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:05,101
to protect detective Beckett.

784
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:06,243
Are you forgetting...

785
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:08,293
we have a deal?

786
00:42:08,623 --> 00:42:10,811
No. What you had was blackmail.

787
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:14,389
Now you're gonna tell me where
all that information is,

788
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:15,454
and after you do,

789
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,379
I'm gonna put Kate Beckett in the ground

790
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:19,398
once and for all.

791
